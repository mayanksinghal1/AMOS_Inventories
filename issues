To remove dead containers
Soln:
Hello,

Thank you for your time on call. As we discussed that there are no mounts for any device of all the DEAD containers.

So, it will be better to delete the mount locations of these containers from /var/lib/docker/devicemapper/mnt/ location and then restart the docker service.

We do not see any entry in /proc/*/mounts and also confirmed it from the umount command.

It will be good if any Openshift engineer sees it fit to restart the docker service.

To check SMTP connection issue:

Soln:
nc -v 10.14.53.199 25

.........................................................................................................................................
     
If master service goes down:

Soln:
check the disk space
du -sh *

.....................................................................................................................

If /elastisearch issue comes-

soln:
oc project logging
oc describe pod logging-curator
oc describe config-map logging curator
oc edit config-map logging curator (check .operations)
oc rollout latest dc/logging-curator

Step4: you have to become root now not chef_admin (sudo su -)

How to check whether our applications in openshift have websense configured or not 

We can to any host either master or node

Cat /etc/sysconfig/docker

Issue: On openshift console developer is getting issue ElasticSearch Pod Status is terminating,(Node was low on resource {Disk Pressure}) 

 

Resolution: firstly did nslookup for ip-10-240-203-112.inv.adroot.lgim.com

 

Log Path: /var/log/messages
You will find out ImageGCFailed messages in logs

This issue mainly occurs due untagged images which should get clear when pruning scripts ran by developer but due to untagging these are getting missed

By this command we can check how many untagged images we have

 

By running this command we can find out all untagged images with id

 
 

Run this command to remove these untagged images.

 


Important : issues faced during instance upgrade

Command to check how many pods are running before draining the pods
[root@ieaavlxosemsn01 ~]# oc get pods --all-namespaces -o wide | grep -i running | wc –l

 

Two other ways if you pods are not getting drained by putting oc adm command

oc adm drain ip-10-240-198-101.inv.adroot.lgim.com --ignore-daemonsets
oc adm drain ip-10-240-198-101.inv.adroot.lgim.com --ignore-daemonsets --delete-local-data
oc adm drain ip-10-240-198-101.inv.adroot.lgim.com --ignore-daemonsets --delete-local-data --force
 

How to change label if you see <none> instead of compute when you fire oc get nodes

Important updates regarding environment

eai  01,03
maple: it also run on eai 01, 03
investment or nexus 02,07
3-scale 05 
dcp 04,06 , initially there was digiops also but there was no use of it so its node were completely taken by dcp.

How to check top imagestreams file

 


INC2210525: multiple moogsoftalerts -Average (1 samples) diskfree on /var/lib/docker/devicemapper and Average (1 samples) disk free on /var/lib/docker/containers is now 15%

Resoltion: Few journal logs have been archived and usage is now below threshold.
[chef_admin@ieaavlxosemsl01 ~]$ df -h
/dev/mapper/rhel-root 18G 12G 6.4G 65% /


journalctl --vacuum-size=4G   - command we will use to archieve logs, we can select size according to our need (select 2G,3G) this incident we usually called root disk incident. Usually these logs should be clear by linux team.

Command to troubleshoot build failure issues
 


Where to check docker container specific logs

Oc get projects | grep <projectname>
Oc project <projectname>
Oc get pods | grep <podname>
Oc describe pod <podname>

Now find out which node is mentioned and also what is container ID
Login to that node
Below mentioned is the path  
/var/lib/docker/containers | grep <container ID>

Where to check node specific logs

Logged into this node
Path : /var/log/messages 

Where to check service related logs

Journalctl logs
Journalctl --help

Where to check docker registry logs

Oc project default
Oc get pods
Oc describe pod <registry pod>
Find node IP and do nslookup to get node (this will be infra node)
/var/lib/docker/containers

New request: “Can you share the Openshift namespace, pod and config map ”

Please see the server details below.
 
[a-ad99912@xlxjumpn00 ~]$ nslookup 10.240.214.71
Server:         10.226.18.13
Address:        10.226.18.13#53
 
71.214.240.10.in-addr.arpa      name = ieabvlxosecmo01.inv.adroot.lgim.com.
 
[a-ad99912@xlxjumpn00 ~]$

Solution: From above information it is cleared that environment is sandbox

Logged into sandbox master host (IEAAVLXOSEMSO01)

As in the email chain it was mentioned that they were looking for fluentd information so it is obvious that project will be logging

 

As IP was given so we used oc get pods –o wide to get IP along with POD

 

As it was clear from pods that it’s a dcp pod and its associated configmap is highlighted below ie dcp
